#Pidgin Default and Android Emoji
Pidgin smileys and Original Android Emoji mapping to Unicode 6 characters

made by treaki by putting together the work of Hylke Bons (Pidgin Default) and Steffen Vogel (Android Emoji)

The content of this repository is based on stv0g/unicode-emoji (https://github.com/stv0g/unicode-emoji) and the original Pidigin smileys gathered from pidgin.im Full URLs:

I made it just for me to use android smileys without giving up my original smileys. Maybe it is useful for someone else...

These Smilies can easily be used in Pidgin by copying the folder to ~/.purple/smileys

Please note that every smiley maps to his dedicated unicode character as specified by Unicode 6.0.
This enables interoperability withs Android & iOS chats clients.
Other chat partners might want to install either the Symbola or Android TrueType font the see the Emojis
